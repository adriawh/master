# üéüÔ∏è LLM-Based Ticket Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and research for my master's thesis, which explores the application of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for public transportation ticket recommendations in **Tr√∏ndelag, Norway**.

## Quatitative data

The generated outputs from all models are found in the quantitative data folder. Files do not follow a specific naming convention, but the ones of relevance can be seen used in the "analysis_results.ipynb" and "analysis_results norwegian.ipynb".

## Qualitative data

All manual reviews can be found in the csv files in the "qualitative data" and "qualitative data norwegian" folders. The files handling this data is the "explanation quality norwegian.ipynb" and "explanation quality.ipynb".

## Cost analysis

Code used for cost analysis, can be found in the "cost calculation.ipynb"
