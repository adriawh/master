You only pay for the trips you actually make.

*   **Your Traveler Category:** Based on your age (37), you fall into the **adult** category (20 to 66 years).
*   **Ticket Details:** A single adult ticket for 1 zone costs 45 NOK. It's valid for one journey on buses, trams, and trains within Zone A (Trondheim). Remember that it must be valid when you board the vehicle, but it will cover your entire continuous journey even if it expires while you are onboard. It's important to note that this ticket is *not* valid on the night bus or night tram and cannot be refunded.

An alternative could be the **Carnet bus (Klippekort buss)**. This costs 450 NOK for 10 single trips in 1 zone. While it doesn't offer a price discount (it's still 45 NOK per trip), it might be slightly more convenient as you purchase 10 trips at once. However, given your infrequent usage pattern, buying single tickets as needed might be simpler and doesn't require an upfront payment.

You mentioned you usually cycle but take the bus occasionally within 1 zone in Trondheim, specifically when the weather is bad. This suggests infrequent and somewhat unpredictable travel needs.

The **Carnet bus** (Klippekort buss) seems like the best fit. It costs 450 NOK for 1 zone and gives you 10 single trips. While the price per trip (45 NOK) is the same as buying individual Single tickets, the Carnet offers convenience. You won't need to buy a ticket each time you unexpectedly decide to take the bus due to weather. You can activate one trip from the carnet when needed.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits (Carnet bus):**
*   Provides 10 single trips for the price of 10.
*   Valid on bus, tram, and train within Zone A (Trondheim).
*   Not valid on the night bus or night tram.
*   You must activate a trip *before* boarding, and it remains valid for the entire journey.
*   Only one trip can be activated at a time.

**Your Traveler Category:**
*   **Adult:** Applies to individuals aged 20 to 66 years.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Single ticket (Enkeltbillett):** If you take the bus *very* rarely (e.g., only once or twice a year), buying a Single ticket for 45 NOK each time might be simpler. It has the same validity rules for daytime travel as a trip from the Carnet but requires purchasing just before each journey.

**Tip:** Consider using the AtB app to purchase and manage your Carnet or Single tickets easily.",2,2,Yes,"No validity periods mentioned, mentions night ticket"

You fall into the **Adult** category (20-66 years). 

**Reasoning:**
*   **Cost-Effective for Infrequent Travel:** Since you only travel occasionally, buying a ticket per trip is the most economical approach. A single ticket for 2 zones costs 90 NOK for an adult.
*   **Flexibility:** You only pay when you travel, without committing to a longer period.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Validity:** Valid for one single journey on buses (and trams/trains within zone A if applicable). It remains valid for the entire journey as long as it was valid when you first boarded.
*   **Restrictions:** Not valid on the night bus or night tram. Cannot be refunded.
*   **Category:** As you are 29 and haven't mentioned being a student or eligible for other discounts, you travel as an 'Adult'.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Carnet bus (Klippekort buss):** This is essentially a bundle of 10 single tickets. For 2 zones as an adult, it costs 900 NOK (10 x 90 NOK). 
    *   **Why it might suit:** It offers convenience as you don't need to purchase a ticket for every single trip. You buy 10 trips upfront.
    *   **Why it might *not* be better:** For the Adult category traveling in 2 zones, there is no price discount per trip compared to buying single tickets individually. It requires a larger upfront payment.

Since you travel occasionally (once or twice a month) within 2 zones, the **Carnet bus (Klippekort buss)** is the most suitable option. 

**Reasoning:**
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The Carnet for 2 zones costs 900 NOK. This gives you 10 single trips, making the cost per trip 90 NOK, which is the same as a standard Single Ticket for 2 zones.
*   **Convenience:** For occasional travel, the Carnet is convenient as you purchase 10 trips upfront and don't need to buy a ticket every time you travel. This fits well with your pattern of 1-2 trips per month.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Validity:** Valid on buses, trams, and trains (within Zone A).
*   **Restrictions:** Not valid on the night bus or night tram. Only one ticket (clip) can be activated at a time.
*   **Journey Completion:** The ticket is valid for your entire journey as long as it's valid when you first board.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Single Ticket (Enkeltbillett):** You could also buy a Single Ticket for each trip. The price for an adult in 2 zones is 90 NOK. This offers maximum flexibility if you prefer to pay per journey or if your travel frequency is very low or unpredictable, making the upfront cost of the Carnet less desirable. However, it requires purchasing a ticket for every trip.

**Tips:**
*   Ensure your specific journeys fall within 2 zones. You can check the zone map provided by AtB.
*   Remember that neither the Carnet nor the standard Single Ticket is valid for night services.
*   As an adult ticket holder, you can bring up to four children under 18 for free on weekends (Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays except May 17th) using the Family Discount Weekend offer when travelling by bus or tram within one zone (though your primary travel is 2 zones, this might be useful if you make a shorter trip on a weekend).",2,2,Yes,"Good, mentions extra tips and night services, which is important"

**Reasoning:**
1.  **Daytime Travel:** For your weekly trips to the city centre, the 'Single ticket' is the best fit. As a 20-year-old student, you qualify for the student price.
    *   Cost per trip (Zone 1, Student): NOK 45
    *   Approximate monthly cost for daytime travel: 4 trips * NOK 45 = NOK 180
2.  **Nighttime Travel:** For your occasional night bus trips, you'll need the 'Night 1' ticket.
    *   Cost per trip (Adult price, no student discount available for this ticket): NOK 120
    *   Approximate monthly cost for night travel: 1 trip * NOK 120 = NOK 120
3.  **Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** NOK 180 + NOK 120 = NOK 300.

This combination is significantly cheaper than purchasing a period ticket like the '30-day ticket' for students (NOK 555 for Zone 1), which would only be economical if you travelled much more frequently (e.g., more than 10 daytime trips plus one night trip per month).

**Your Traveler Category:**
You fall under the **student** category (under 35 with valid student ID). This grants you discounts on Single tickets and period tickets (30/60/90/180 days).
*   **Important:** You must carry a valid student ID (showing your name, date of birth, photo, place of study, and valid semester) and present it during ticket inspections.
*   Note that the 'Night 1' ticket does not have a student price; you must purchase the adult ticket for NOK 120.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Single Ticket (Student, Zone 1):** Costs NOK 45. Valid for one journey on buses, trams, and trains within Zone A (Trondheim). It's *not* valid on the night bus/tram. The ticket must be valid when you board, but remains valid for the entire journey even if it expires during the trip.
*   **Night 1 Ticket (Adult):** Costs NOK 120. Valid for a single trip on specific night buses (101-116, 4101) and the night tram between 00:30 and 04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights. It does not allow transfers.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **30-day ticket (Student, Zone 1):** Costs NOK 555. This offers unlimited travel on buses, trams, and trains within Zone 1, *including* the night bus and night tram. While much more expensive based on your current usage, it could be considered if your travel frequency increases significantly, offering convenience and potentially becoming cheaper if you make many more trips.

**Tips:**
*   Purchase your tickets before boarding, for example, using the AtB app.
*   Always ensure you have your valid student ID with you when traveling on a student ticket.

- Buying 8 'Single tickets' for 2 zones would cost 8 * 90 NOK = 720 NOK.
- The '7-day ticket' for an adult covering 2 zones costs 630 NOK.

Therefore, the **7-day ticket is the most cost-effective option**. It covers your entire 4-day stay, is cheaper than buying the minimum number of single tickets you'd need, and offers the flexibility of unlimited travel within those two zones during the 7-day validity period.

1.  **Duration & Frequency:** You need a ticket for about 7 days with frequent use, including the night bus.
2.  **Category:** As a 20-year-old student, you qualify for the 'student' category (ensure you have valid student ID as described in the general info).
3.  **Night Bus:** You specifically need night bus access. The rules for period tickets (like the 7-day or 30-day) state they are 'Valid on nightbus and nighttram except for adult category'. This implies that student category tickets *do* cover the night bus.
4.  **Ticket Options Analysis:**
    *   **Single tickets (45 NOK student)** or **24-hour tickets (135 NOK adult)** are not cost-effective for frequent travel over a week and do not cover the night bus.
    *   The **7-day ticket** only lists prices for adult/child/senior (315 NOK for adult in 1 zone). There's no student price listed. Even if you bought the adult version, it likely wouldn't cover the night bus due to the 'except for adult category' rule.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Duration:** It covers exactly 7 days.
*   **Frequency:** It allows unlimited trips, which is ideal since you're using the bus ""a lot"".
*   **Night Bus:** The 7-day ticket includes travel on the night bus and night tram for most categories. The rules state it's valid 'except for adult category'. As a student, you fall into a separate category. Although there isn't a specific student price for the 7-day ticket (meaning you'll pay the adult price), the exclusion typically applies only to the 'adult' category itself, not other categories paying the adult price. Therefore, you should be covered on the night bus.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The price for a 1-zone 7-day ticket is 315 NOK (adult price). A single ticket costs 45 NOK and doesn't cover the night bus.

For regular daily travel, a period ticket is significantly more cost-effective than buying Single tickets (which would cost 90 NOK per day, or roughly 1890 NOK for 21 working days).

The **30-day ticket** for 1 zone costs 926 NOK. This allows unlimited travel on buses (and trams/trains in zone A) within your chosen zone for 30 days. This is cheaper than buying four 7-day tickets (4 x 315 NOK = 1260 NOK).

Given that you commute daily, the 30-day ticket offers the best value for your current needs.

**Tip:**

**Reasoning:**
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** A single trip for a child in one zone costs 22 NOK. Traveling 2-3 times a week means at least 4-6 single trips per week (to and from events). Over a month (approx. 4 weeks), this amounts to 16-24 single trips, costing between 352 NOK (16 * 22) and 528 NOK (24 * 22). If she travels more often, the cost of single tickets increases further. The 30-day ticket for a child in one zone costs 370 NOK, which is cheaper than buying single tickets even for the lower end of your estimate, and significantly cheaper if she travels more.
*   **Unlimited Travel:** This ticket offers unlimited travel within the selected zone(s) for 30 days. This provides flexibility for unexpected extra trips or spontaneous journeys without incurring additional costs.
*   **Convenience:** You purchase it once, and it's valid for the entire month, eliminating the need to buy tickets for each trip.
*   **Night Travel:** The 30-day ticket for children includes travel on the night bus and night tram, which might be relevant for social events.

**Assumption:** I have assumed that all her travel will be within a single zone (Zone 1), which is common for local travel. If her journeys cross into multiple zones, the price for the 30-day ticket will be higher, but it will likely still be the most economical option compared to single tickets for multiple zones.

*   **Category:** Your daughter falls into the 'child' category (ages 6 to 19).

*   **Eligibility:** This ticket is specifically for travellers aged 16 to 19 inclusive.
*   **Cost-Effective:** At 555 NOK for 30 days, it's significantly cheaper than other period tickets for your travel needs. For comparison, a 30-day Student ticket for 3 zones costs 930 NOK.
*   **Coverage:** It offers county-wide validity in Trøndelag, covering your required 3 zones and potentially more if needed.
*   **Inclusions:** It's valid on buses, trams (in zone A), express boats, and importantly for weekend travel, it includes the night bus and night tram.

**Your Traveler Category:**
You fall into the **Youth** category (16-19 years old). While you are also a student, the Youth ticket offers better value and broader coverage than the standard Student discount for period tickets in your age group.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   Valid for 30 days.
*   Unlimited travel on buses, trams (Zone A), and express boats throughout Trøndelag county.
*   Includes travel on night buses and night trams.
*   You must be able to prove your age upon request (e.g., with an ID card, passport, or bank card with a picture).

**Alternative Option:**
*   **30-day Student Ticket (3 zones):** This would cost 930 NOK. While it covers your zones and student status, it's much more expensive than the Youth ticket and doesn't automatically cover the entire county or night travel for students.

**Tip:** Always carry valid identification to prove your age when using the Youth ticket, as you may be asked for it during ticket inspections.",1,2,No,"Doesnt mention the child category which would be cheaper than the student categoruy.

Here's why:

1.  **Eligibility:** It's specifically designed for travellers aged 16 to 19.
2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** For 555 NOK, it offers unlimited travel for 30 days. Given your planned commute (4 days/week) and especially the high usage during 'Fadderuke', this is much cheaper than buying single tickets (a single trip in Zone 1 costs 45 NOK for adults/students or 22 NOK for children/youth).
3.  **Night Travel Included:** Crucially, the Youth Ticket is valid on the night bus and night tram, which you anticipate needing during the first couple of weeks.
4.  **Coverage:** It's valid across all zones in Trøndelag county on buses, trams (in Zone A), and even express boats, giving you flexibility to explore during Fadderuke without worrying about zones.
5.  **Convenience:** It covers your first month, including the initial high-usage period and the transition to your regular schedule, without needing a specific student ID right away (proof of age is sufficient).

**About the Youth Category:**
*   You fall into the 'youth' category (16-19 years old).
*   You need to be able to present valid identification showing your age if requested during a ticket inspection.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Validity:** 30 consecutive days from activation.
*   **Usage:** Unlimited trips on buses, trams (Zone A), express boats, and night services within Trøndelag.
*   **Activation:** The ticket is valid for the entire journey if it's valid when you first board.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **7-day Ticket (Child price):** You could initially buy a 7-day ticket for Zone 1 at the Child price (130 NOK), as the Child category covers ages 6-19. This is cheaper upfront and covers night travel. You could buy this weekly for the first two weeks (total 260 NOK). However, the Youth Ticket offers better value if you travel regularly after Fadderuke (costing ~130 NOK per week on average) and provides county-wide travel, which might be beneficial. Given your planned regular commute, the Youth Ticket covering the full 30 days is likely more convenient and economical in the long run.

**Tips:**
*   Consider purchasing and managing your ticket through the AtB app for ease of use.
*   Always carry your ID as proof of age when traveling on a Youth Ticket.
*   Familiarize yourself with the bus routes and schedules between your home and campus, especially the night bus schedule if needed.",2,2,No,"What it presents is correct, but it has missed important tickets, and here the 180 day child ticket would be cheaper."

Even buying three separate 30-day tickets (3 x 370 NOK = 1110 NOK) or a 60-day and a 30-day ticket (740 + 370 = 1110 NOK) offers no cost advantage and requires multiple purchases.

Even though you'll be away for one week, the overall savings during the 6 months (180 days) make this the most economical option for consistent, long-term commuting.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Occasional Travel:** The Carnet provides a bundle of single trips (usually 10) that can be used whenever needed, fitting the 'occasional' travel pattern better than buying a single ticket each time or using a period pass.
*   **Convenience:** Having the Carnet means your child always has a ticket ready, avoiding the need to purchase one before each infrequent trip.
*   **Cost-Effective:** While the upfront cost is higher than a single ticket, the price per trip is the same (e.g., 220 NOK for 10 trips in 1 zone, which is 22 NOK per trip, the same as a single child ticket for 1 zone). You pay for the convenience of having tickets available.

**Assumption:**
*   I have assumed the child will mostly travel within **1 zone**. If the child needs to travel across multiple zones, you should purchase a Carnet valid for the required number of zones.

**Ticket Information (Carnet bus - Child - 1 Zone):**
*   **Price:** 220 NOK (for 10 trips)
*   **Validity:** Valid on bus (also valid on tram/train in zone A).
*   **Restrictions:** Not valid on the night bus and night tram. Only one ticket (clip) can be activated at a time.
*   **Traveler Category:** Your child falls into the **'child'** category (6 to 19 years old).

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Single ticket (Enkeltbillett):** You could buy a Single ticket for each trip (45 NOK for adult, 22 NOK for child in 1 zone). This is cheaper upfront for each trip but requires purchasing a ticket every time the child travels.

**Tip:**
*   Confirm the number of zones required for your child's typical journeys. You can usually find zone maps on the transport provider's website (AtB). The Carnet needs to be purchased for the maximum number of zones traveled in a single journey.",2,2,Yes,

*   It costs 45 NOK for one zone.
*   You pay per trip, which is ideal when you don't travel often.
*   The ticket is valid for your entire journey on buses (and also trams/trains within zone A, which covers Trondheim), as long as it's valid when you first board.

*   The Carnet gives you 10 pre-paid single trips for the price of 10 individual single tickets (450 NOK for 1 zone). While it doesn't offer a discount per trip (each trip still costs 45 NOK), it saves you the hassle of buying a new ticket every time you decide to take the bus.
*   It's designed for infrequent travelers like yourself who want a practical solution.
*   Each activated ticket is valid for your entire journey on buses, trams, and trains within Zone A, as long as the ticket is valid when you first board.
*   Please note that the Carnet is not valid on the night bus or night tram, and only one ticket can be activated at a time.

**Alternative Option:**
*   If you travel very rarely (only a couple of times per year), buying a **Single ticket (Enkeltbillett)** each time might be simpler. It costs 45 NOK for one zone and offers the most flexibility, as you only pay when you travel. However, you would need to purchase it each time you need it.

**Travel Tip:**
*   If you happen to travel on a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday (except May 17th), remember our Family Discount Weekend offer. With your valid adult ticket (like one activated from a Carnet), you can bring up to four children under 18 for free on buses and trams within one zone.

Thank you for reaching out. It's great that you're planning your public transport use. Let's find the best ticket option for you.

Based on your information – being a 20-year-old student who travels by bus within one zone about once a week, and uses the night bus occasionally (around once a month) – the most economical approach would be to buy tickets for each journey.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **For your daytime trips:** The **Single ticket** (Enkeltbillett) is suitable. 
    *   It costs 45 NOK for travel within 1 zone. As a student aged 20-34, you fall into the student category, but please note that for a single ticket in one zone, the price is the same as the adult price.
    *   This ticket is valid for your bus journey to the city centre.
    *   If you travel once a week, assuming this involves a return trip, that's about 8 single trips per month, costing approximately 360 NOK (8 trips * 45 NOK).
    *   This ticket is *not* valid on the night bus.

2.  **For your night bus trips:** You will need a separate **Night 1 ticket** (Natt 1).
    *   This costs 120 NOK per trip.
    *   It's specifically for the night bus and night tram services.
    *   One trip per month would cost 120 NOK.

**Recommendation:** Buying **Single tickets** for your day trips and **Night 1 tickets** for your night trips seems best. Your estimated total monthly cost would be around 480 NOK (360 NOK + 120 NOK). This pay-as-you-go method directly matches your current travel needs and is the most cost-effective option based on the frequency you described.

**Alternative Option:**
You could also consider the **30-day ticket** (30-dagersbillett) for students.
*   This costs 555 NOK for 1 zone.
*   It offers unlimited travel on buses, trams (and trains in Zone A) within your zone for 30 days.
*   Crucially, the student 30-day ticket *is* valid on the night bus.
*   While it costs about 75 NOK more per month than paying per trip based on your estimate, it might be worth considering if you anticipate traveling more frequently some months, or if you value the convenience of having a pass that covers all your trips, including the night bus, without needing separate purchases.

**Important Note for Students:**
Although the single ticket price is the same as the adult price in Zone 1, if you were to buy a 30-day ticket or travel in more zones where student discounts apply, you would need to prove your eligibility. Remember that student discounts apply up to age 34, and you must have a valid student ID that includes your name, date of birth, photo, place of study, and the current valid semester. Always carry this with you when traveling on a student ticket.

**Tip:** You can easily purchase both Single tickets and Night 1 tickets using the AtB mobile app before you board.

I hope this explanation helps you choose the right ticket! Let me know if you have any more questions.",2,2,No,"The logic and factual correctness is very good, however it simply dissregards the 180 day ticket which would be cheaper. "

Since you are 45 years old, you fall into the 'adult' traveler category (ages 20-66). For a single day of frequent travel within one zone, the **24-hour ticket** is the most convenient and likely the most cost-effective option. 

Here's why:
*   **Unlimited Travel:** It allows unlimited trips on our buses (and trams/trains within zone A) for 24 hours from the moment you activate it. This is perfect for seeing as much as possible without worrying about buying a new ticket for each trip.
*   **Cost-Effective:** The price for a 1-zone adult 24-hour ticket is 135 NOK. A single adult ticket for 1 zone costs 45 NOK. If you plan on taking three or more bus trips during the day, the 24-hour ticket offers better value than buying individual single tickets.

**Alternative Option:**
If you end up taking only one or two trips, buying **Single tickets** (45 NOK each for 1 zone) would be cheaper. However, given your plan for frequent travel, the 24-hour ticket provides peace of mind and flexibility.

For your day in Trondheim, traveling within one zone as an adult (since you are 50 years old), I recommend the **24-hour ticket**.

Here's why:
*   **Cost-Effective for Multiple Trips:** You mentioned traveling between your hotel, the conference venue, and evening events. This likely means three or more separate journeys. The 24-hour ticket costs 135 NOK for one zone and allows unlimited travel by bus and tram (in Zone A) for 24 hours from the first activation. Buying three single tickets would cost the same (3 x 45 NOK = 135 NOK), and any additional trips would make the 24-hour ticket cheaper.
*   **Convenience:** With a 24-hour ticket, you don't need to worry about buying a new ticket for each trip throughout the day.
*   **Validity:** It's valid on all our regular buses and trams within your chosen zone (Zone A, presumably Trondheim city). Please note it's not valid on the specific night bus/tram services that run very late on weekends.

**Traveler Category:** Based on your age (50), you fall under the 'adult' category, which applies to travelers aged 20 to 66.

**Alternative:** If you are absolutely certain you will only make *two* separate journeys during the entire day, buying two **Single tickets** (45 NOK each, total 90 NOK) would be cheaper. However, for the flexibility to travel more, the 24-hour ticket is usually the better choice for a full day of activities.

Please note that the adult 7-day ticket is not valid on the night bus or night tram.

An alternative could be purchasing multiple '24-hour tickets'. A 24-hour ticket for an adult in 1 zone costs 135 NOK.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Cost-Effective:** You plan to travel at least twice a day for 4 days, which is a minimum of 8 trips. A 7-day ticket for 2 zones costs 630 NOK for an adult. Buying 8 single tickets for 2 zones would cost 720 NOK (8 trips * 90 NOK/trip). Therefore, the 7-day ticket is cheaper than buying individual tickets for your planned journeys.
*   **Convenience & Flexibility:** This ticket gives you unlimited travel within your selected 2 zones for 7 consecutive days. This covers your entire 4-day stay and allows for any additional trips you might want to make during that time without extra cost.
*   **Your Traveler Category:** As you are 28 years old, you fall into the 'adult' category (20 to 66 years).

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**

*   Please note that for the 'adult' category, this ticket is *not* valid on the night bus or night tram.
*   The ticket is valid for the entire journey as long as it's valid when you first board.

**Alternative Option:**

While there is a 7-day ticket available, the rules state it's not valid on the night bus for the adult category, and there isn't a specific student price listed for the 7-day ticket, meaning you'd likely have to buy the adult version which excludes night travel.
2.  **Student Category:** As a 20-year-old student, you qualify for the student discount on the 30-day ticket, making it more affordable (555 NOK for 1 zone) than the adult price.
3.  **Unlimited Travel:** This ticket gives you unlimited travel on buses (and trams/trains in zone A) within your chosen zone for 30 days. Although you only need it for a week, given you've been using the bus 'a lot', this often works out cheaper and more convenient than buying multiple single tickets (45 NOK each, not valid on night bus) and night tickets (120 NOK each).

**Important Tip:** Remember to always carry your valid student ID with you when travelling, as you may be asked to show it during a ticket inspection to prove you're eligible for the discount.

**Alternative Option:** If you anticipate only using the bus very infrequently over the next week (perhaps just one or two more night bus trips and very few daytime trips), buying individual **Single tickets** for day travel and **Night 1 tickets** for night travel *might* be cheaper. However, the cost can add up quickly, and the 30-day ticket offers peace of mind with unlimited travel.",2,2,Yes,"Saying that prices listed doesnt include is a bit werid, and doesnt sound like someone who know the system in and out. but otherwise very good"

*   **Cost-Effective:** Since you've been using the bus frequently, this ticket will likely be much cheaper than buying single tickets (45 NOK each) or separate night bus tickets (120 NOK each).

**Traveler Category & Price:** You fall under the **student** category (20 years old, studying in Trondheim). While there isn't a specific student price listed for the 7-day ticket, students typically pay the adult price for this ticket type, similar to the single ticket. For 1 zone, the price is 315 NOK.

The 30-day ticket costs only 926 NOK for unlimited travel within your zone for 30 days, offering significant savings. It's also cheaper than buying four 7-day tickets (4 * 315 NOK = 1260 NOK).
2.  **Flexibility:** You mentioned your situation might change later this year. A 30-day ticket provides a good balance between cost savings for regular travel and the flexibility to adapt if your commute changes, without committing to a very long period.
3.  **Convenience:** It offers unlimited travel on buses (and trams/trains in zone A) within your chosen zone for 30 consecutive days. This is great not just for your commute but also for any other trips you might take within that zone during the period.

**Your Traveler Category:** As you are 40 years old, you fall into the **adult** category (ages 20-66).

Welcome to Trondheim and AtB. Based on your situation, I recommend the **Youth ticket (Ungdomsbillett)**.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Eligibility:** As you are 18 years old, you perfectly fit the 'Youth' category (ages 16-19 inclusive).
*   **Cost-Effective for Frequent Travel:** The Youth ticket costs 555 NOK and offers unlimited travel for 30 days. Considering you'll be using the bus frequently, especially during 'Fadderuke' and for classes 4 days a week, this is much more economical than buying single tickets.
*   **Includes Night Travel:** You mentioned needing to travel after midnight during 'Fadderuke'. The Youth ticket is valid on the night bus and night tram, which is ideal for getting around during evening events.
*   **County-Wide Validity:** Although you currently only need to travel within one zone (your home to campus), the Youth ticket is valid for unlimited travel on buses, trams (in Zone A), and even express boats throughout the *entire* Trøndelag county. This gives you great flexibility to explore Trondheim and its surroundings during 'Fadderuke' or later, without needing to buy extra tickets.

**Alternative Option:**

*   **30-day Child Ticket:** Since you are 18, you also qualify for the 'Child' category (ages 6-19). The 30-day ticket for the Child category costs 370 NOK for one zone. It also includes unlimited travel and night bus/tram validity within that single zone.
*   **Why it might be suitable:** It's cheaper than the Youth ticket if you are absolutely certain you will *only* travel within your single zone for the entire 30 days.
*   **Why Youth is likely better:** The Youth ticket offers significantly more value for 185 NOK extra, providing county-wide travel freedom, which is often very useful for students, especially during introduction weeks.

**Important Information:**

*   **Youth Category:** This ticket is specifically for travellers aged 16 up to and including 19. Remember to carry valid ID (like a bank card, passport, or driver's license) to prove your age if requested during a ticket inspection.
*   **Activation:** You can easily purchase and activate the ticket in the AtB app.

*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** For daily travel, a period ticket is much cheaper than buying single tickets. The 60-day student ticket for 1 zone costs 1110 NOK. This allows unlimited travel within your zone for the entire duration.

**Important Note for Students:** Remember to carry a valid student ID that meets our requirements (includes your name, date of birth, photo, place of study, and current semester validity) as you may be asked to show it during ticket inspections.

**Alternative Option:**
You could also consider purchasing two consecutive **30-day student tickets** for 1 zone. Each costs 555 NOK, so the total price for 60 days would be the same (1110 NOK).

The **90-day ticket** is the best recommendation for you. It offers unlimited travel on buses, trams, and trains within Zone A (which covers Trondheim city) for exactly 90 days. This perfectly matches your three-month contract period and covers all your commuting and weekend travel needs within that zone for a fixed price (2778 NOK for 1 zone).

Here's why:
*   **Duration:** It covers your entire 3-month visit with a single purchase.
*   **Cost-Effective:** For daily travel over 90 days, this period ticket offers unlimited rides and is significantly cheaper than buying single tickets (22 NOK each for seniors) or shorter duration tickets repeatedly. The price for a 90-day senior ticket in 1 zone is 1110 NOK.

*   **Validity:** The ticket allows unlimited trips on buses, trams, and trains (within zone A) in your selected zone for 90 consecutive days. It is also valid on the night bus and night tram for the senior category.

**Your Traveler Category:** As you are 68, you fall into the **senior** category (applicable to those 67 years or older). Please remember to carry identification that confirms your age, as you may be asked to show it during ticket inspections.

**Alternative Option:** You could alternatively purchase three separate **30-day tickets** for seniors (370 NOK each, totalling 1110 NOK).

As a 20-year-old student, you technically fall into the 'student' category (for students under 35 with a valid ID). However, for single tickets within 1 zone, the price is the same for adults and students (45 NOK).

Here's the breakdown:
*   **Daytime Travel:** You travel about once a week (4 times a month). 4 trips x 45 NOK/trip = 180 NOK per month.
*   **Night Bus Travel:** You use the night bus about once a month. A standard single ticket is *not* valid on the night bus. You would need to purchase a 'Night 1' ticket for each night bus trip, which costs 120 NOK. 
*   **Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** 180 NOK (daytime) + 120 NOK (night bus) = 300 NOK.

A single ticket allows unlimited transfers within zone A (including bus, tram, and train) for 90 minutes after activation (or up to 3 hours if activated after 18:00 weekdays or anytime weekends). The Night 1 ticket is valid for a single trip on specific night services without transfers.

**Traveler Category:** You are eligible for the 'student' discount (under 35 with valid student ID) on periodic tickets (like 30-day or 180-day), but not on single tickets where the price is the same as 'adult'. Remember to carry your valid student ID if you opt for a student periodic ticket in the future.

**Alternative Option:**
The cheapest periodic ticket for students is the **180-day student ticket** for 1 zone, costing 2775 NOK, which averages 462.50 NOK per month. While this is more expensive than your current estimated 300 NOK monthly cost, it offers unlimited travel, includes night bus travel (saving you the 120 NOK Night 1 ticket cost), free access to Trondheim City Bike, and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. If your travel increases to more than 10 single trips per month, or if you value the convenience and included benefits like the night bus and city bikes, the 180-day ticket could become a better option.",2,1,No,"Here it mistakenly thinks that traveling 4 times is just taking the bus 4 times, when in reality this is usually 8 given the to and from travel.

Buying single tickets at 45 NOK each would become more expensive if you take three or more trips throughout the day. The 24-hour ticket lets you hop on and off as much as you like without worrying about buying a new ticket each time. Please note that it is not valid on the night bus or night tram. Your journey is covered as long as the ticket is valid when you board.

1.  **Single Tickets:** A single adult ticket for 2 zones costs 90 NOK. Traveling to and from the event daily means at least 2 trips per day, totaling 8 trips over 4 days. This would cost a minimum of 8 * 90 NOK = 720 NOK.
2.  **7-day Ticket:** A 7-day adult ticket for 2 zones costs 630 NOK. This ticket allows unlimited travel within your selected zones for 7 consecutive days.

Comparing the costs, the **7-day ticket** is the most economical choice at 630 NOK, saving you at least 90 NOK compared to buying single tickets. It also offers the convenience of unlimited travel, so you can take extra trips without additional cost. 

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Category:** Adult (20-66 years).
*   **Validity:** The 7-day ticket is valid for unlimited trips within the chosen 2 zones for 7 consecutive days. It's valid on buses (and trams/trains if traveling within zone A). Your entire journey is covered as long as the ticket is valid when you board.
*   **Included Services:** Period tickets like the 7-day one include free use of Trondheim City Bikes and 2 hours of free Hyre car rental each month. Note that the adult category 7-day ticket is *not* valid on the night bus or night tram.

**Alternative:**
*   **Single Tickets:** If you were making fewer than 7 trips in total during your 4-day stay (630 NOK / 90 NOK/trip ≈ 7 trips), single tickets would be cheaper. However, based on your plan for daily round trips, the 7-day ticket is better value.

**Tip:** Since your visit includes a weekend (April 19th-20th), if you happen to travel with children under 18 on Saturday or Sunday, the Family Discount Weekend allows you to bring up to four children for free with your valid adult ticket when traveling within one zone by bus or tram.",2,2,Yes,"Longer answer, but overall very good"

Remember to carry your valid student ID when traveling. Since you need a ticket for frequent travel, including the night bus, for the remaining week within one zone, the **30-day student ticket** is the best option.

Here's why:
1.  **Night Bus Access:** You specifically mentioned needing the night bus. The 30-day student ticket includes unlimited travel on regular buses and trams (in zone A), as well as the night bus.
2.  **Cost-Effectiveness:** While you only need it for a week, buying single tickets frequently plus separate night bus tickets (120 NOK per trip) would quickly become more expensive. A single student ticket costs 45 NOK (same as adult for 1 zone) and isn't valid on the night bus. Even just a few regular trips plus a couple of night bus rides would likely exceed the 555 NOK cost of the 30-day student ticket.
3.  **Short-Term Alternatives:** Other short-term options like the 7-day ticket don't have a student category, and the adult version (315 NOK) does *not* include night bus access. Single tickets and 24-hour tickets also don't cover the night bus.

Therefore, even though it's valid for 30 days, this ticket provides the necessary night bus access and unlimited travel for your frequent use this week at the most economical price point compared to alternatives.

Given your need for frequent travel, including the night bus, over the next week, the 7-day ticket is the most suitable option duration-wise. Crucially, the 7-day ticket includes night bus travel for students (the exclusion only applies to the adult category).

You mentioned she'll be traveling 2-3 times a week, possibly more, for the next month. Let's assume her travel is within 1 zone, which is common for local activities.

Here's a cost comparison:
*   **Single tickets:** A single child ticket for 1 zone costs 22 NOK. Traveling 2-3 times a week means about 16-24 trips per month (assuming round trips). This would cost between 352 NOK (16 * 22) and 528 NOK (24 * 22), or potentially more if she travels extra days.
*   **30-day ticket:** A 30-day child ticket for 1 zone costs 370 NOK. This offers unlimited travel within that zone for 30 days.

Based on this, the **30-day child ticket** is the best recommendation. It costs only slightly more than the minimum estimate using single tickets (370 NOK vs 352 NOK) and becomes cheaper if she makes just one extra trip (17 trips total) during the month. Given that her usage might increase, the unlimited travel offers peace of mind and better value. This ticket is also valid on night buses, which could be useful for social events, and includes access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental (though these might be less relevant for her age).

**Assumption:** I've assumed she will only travel within **one zone**. If her travel requires crossing into multiple zones, the price for the 30-day ticket will be higher (e.g., 495 NOK for 2 zones), and we should re-evaluate. Please let me know if she needs to travel across different zones.

**Alternative:** If you are very certain she will make 16 trips or fewer in the month, buying single tickets as needed would be slightly cheaper. However, the 30-day pass offers more flexibility and value if her travel frequency increases even slightly.

**Tip:** Remember the 'Family discount weekend'. On Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, if you travel with her using your own valid adult/senior/student ticket, she (and up to three other children under 18) can travel with you for free within one zone.",2,2,Yes,

For travel within just one zone, the 'Child' category offers the cheapest tickets.

Given that you'll be traveling frequently (4 days a week regularly, plus extra trips during 'Fadderuke', including potentially late nights), a periodic ticket is much more economical than single tickets. Single child tickets are 22 NOK each, which would quickly add up.

The most cost-effective option for you is the **180-day Child ticket** for one zone. It costs 1850 NOK, which averages out to about **308 NOK per month**. This is cheaper than the 30-day Child ticket (370 NOK per month).

**Benefits and Rules:**
*   **Traveler Category:** As an 18-year-old, you fit the 'Child' category (ages 6-19).
*   **Unlimited Travel:** This ticket gives you unlimited travel within your chosen zone (Zone A, presumably, which covers the main city and campus areas) for 180 days.
*   **Night Bus Included:** Crucially for 'Fadderuke' and student life, periodic tickets in the Child, Youth, and Student categories include travel on the night bus and night tram.
*   **Other Transport:** If you are traveling within Zone A, the ticket is also valid on the tram and local trains.
*   **Included Services:** You also get free access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of free Hyre car rental each month.
*   **Validity:** Your journey is covered as long as the ticket is valid when you first board the bus/tram/train.

**Alternative Option:**
If you prefer a lower upfront cost or are unsure about your travel needs for a full six months, the **30-day Child ticket** is a good alternative. It costs **370 NOK** and offers the same benefits (unlimited travel in 1 zone, night bus, city bike, Hyre) but for a shorter period.

Given that you'll be traveling regularly (4 days a week) and expect high usage initially, including potentially after midnight during 'Fadderuke', a periodic ticket is much more economical than single tickets. A single child ticket costs 22 NOK, so traveling 4 days a week (8 trips) would cost around 704 NOK per month, without including the extra trips during 'Fadderuke' or night travel.

Your child falls into the 'child' category, which covers ages 6 to 19.

**Reasoning:**
*   **Cost-Effective for Occasional Use:** The Carnet provides 10 single trips for the price of 10 individual single tickets (220 NOK for 1 zone, which is 22 NOK per trip). Since travel is occasional, buying periodic tickets like a 30-day pass (370 NOK for 1 zone) would be much more expensive unless the child travels more than 16 times a month.
*   **Convenience & Availability:** The main advantage of the Carnet over buying single tickets each time is convenience. It ensures your child always has pre-paid tickets ready to use, fulfilling your requirement for availability without needing a last-minute purchase.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Category:** Child (6-19 years).
*   **Validity:** Each 'clip' or activation is valid for one journey on the bus (and tram/train within zone A if applicable). It's valid for the entire journey as long as it's activated upon boarding.
*   **Limitations:** Not valid on the night bus or night tram. Only one ticket (clip) can be activated at a time.
*   **Assumption:** This recommendation assumes travel is primarily within **1 zone**. If travel across multiple zones is needed, Carnets are available for more zones, but the price per trip increases (e.g., 450 NOK for 10 trips in 2 zones).

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Single Tickets:** You could simply buy a **Single ticket** (child category, 22 NOK for 1 zone) each time your child travels. This costs the same per trip as the Carnet but is less convenient as it requires purchasing a ticket before every journey.

**Tips:**
*   The Carnet can usually be purchased and managed easily via the AtB app or loaded onto an AtB travel card.
*   Remember the **Family Discount Weekend**: On Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays, an adult with a valid ticket (adult, senior, or student) can bring up to four children under 18 for free within one zone.

Since you only use the bus occasionally when the weather is bad and travel within one zone, the Single ticket is likely the best and most economical option for you. Each trip costs 45 NOK. You only pay when you actually travel, which offers the most flexibility for infrequent use.

Periodic tickets like the 30-day ticket (926 NOK) or even the 7-day ticket (315 NOK) would require you to travel much more frequently (more than 20 times a month for the 30-day ticket, or 7 times a week for the 7-day ticket) to be cheaper than buying single tickets.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:**
*   **Category:** Adult (20-66 years).
*   **Validity:** A single ticket is valid for your entire journey as long as it's valid when you first board the bus, tram, or train (within zone A).
*   **Where to use:** It's valid on the bus, and also on the tram and train within zone A (which includes Trondheim).
*   **Night Travel:** Note that the standard single ticket is not valid on the night bus or night tram.

**Alternative Option:**
*   **Carnet bus (10 trips):** This costs 450 NOK for 10 single trips within one zone. It works out to the exact same price per trip (45 NOK) as buying individual single tickets, so there's no cost saving. However, some people find it convenient to pre-pay for 10 trips at once, so you don't have to buy a ticket each time you travel. Given your very occasional use, the flexibility of the single ticket might still be better.

A single adult ticket for 2 zones costs 90 NOK per trip. If you travel twice a month (assuming round trips), that's four trips, costing 360 NOK in total with single tickets.

The Carnet bus ticket for 10 trips costs 900 NOK for 2 zones, which is also 90 NOK per trip. It doesn't offer any savings compared to single tickets and requires a larger upfront payment, making it less flexible for infrequent travel.

Based on your travel pattern – about one day a week (roughly 8 single trips per month) plus one night bus trip per month, all within one zone – let's compare the costs:

1.  **Single Tickets + Night Ticket:** A single student ticket costs 45 NOK. For 8 regular trips, that's 360 NOK. The specific Night 1 ticket costs 120 NOK. Your estimated total monthly cost would be around 360 + 120 = 480 NOK.
2.  **180-day Student Ticket:** This ticket costs 2775 NOK for 1 zone, which averages out to 462.50 NOK per month. This is slightly cheaper than buying single tickets and a separate night ticket based on your estimated usage.

The **180-day student ticket** is recommended because it's the most cost-effective option for your regular, albeit infrequent, travel pattern. It offers unlimited travel within Zone 1 (including bus, tram, and train in Zone A), covers the night bus (saving you the 120 NOK separate ticket), and includes benefits like free access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. This provides convenience and better value if your travel remains consistent or slightly increases.

**Alternative Option:**
If your travel varies significantly each month and you might travel less than estimated (e.g., fewer than 8 regular trips + 1 night trip), buying **Single tickets** (45 NOK each) for your regular trips and a **Night 1 ticket** (120 NOK) when needed could be more economical. This offers maximum flexibility, as you only pay for the trips you actually take. However, it requires buying tickets more often and is slightly more expensive if your usage matches your estimate.

Du må huske å alltid ha med gyldig studentbevis på reisen.

Du reiser ca. én dag i uken innenfor én sone (rundt 8 turer per måned) og bruker nattbussen omtrent én gang i måneden. La oss se på kostnadene:

1.  **Enkeltbilletter:** 8 turer x 45 NOK/tur = 360 NOK. I tillegg trenger du en Natt 1-billett for nattbussen til 120 NOK. Total månedlig kostnad: 360 + 120 = 480 NOK.
2.  **30-dagers studentbillett (1 sone):** Denne koster 555 NOK per måned. Den gir deg ubegrenset reise innenfor sonen din, og viktigst av alt, den *inkluderer* bruk av nattbuss. Den inkluderer også gratis bruk av Trondheim Bysykkel og 2 timer gratis Hyre leiebil hver måned.

Selv om 30-dagersbilletten er litt dyrere (75 NOK mer) enn å kjøpe enkeltbilletter pluss nattbillett basert på *minimumsbruken* din, anbefaler jeg **30-dagers studentbillett**. Grunnen er at den inkluderer nattbussen (du slipper å tenke på egen billett for det), gir deg ubegrenset reise (så hvis du reiser bare én ekstra tur-retur i måneden, blir den billigere enn enkeltbilletter), og inkluderer tilleggsfordeler som bysykkel og leiebil. Dette gir mer fleksibilitet og bekvemmelighet.

**Alternativ:**
Hvis du er helt sikker på at du *aldri* reiser mer enn ca. 8 vanlige turer pluss én nattbusstur per måned, kan du spare litt ved å kjøpe **enkeltbilletter** for dagsturene (45 NOK per tur) og en **Natt 1-billett** (120 NOK) de gangene du trenger nattbuss. Dette er den billigste løsningen (480 NOK/måned) ved lav bruk, men mindre fleksibel og krever at du kjøper billett hver gang (eller bruker Klippekort, som koster det samme per tur som enkeltbillett).

**Tips:**
*   Alle billettyper (enkeltbillett, periodebillett) er gyldige på både buss, trikk og tog innenfor sone A.
*   Husk gyldig studentbevis (med navn, fødselsdato, bilde, studiested og gyldig semester).",2,2,No,"So here the answer is actually in norwegian, so not in the users language.

You estimate she'll travel 2-3 times a week, possibly more, which means around 16-24 trips or more over a month.

Let's look at the costs assuming she travels within 1 zone:
*   **Single tickets:** Each trip costs 22 NOK. For 16-24 trips, the total monthly cost would be between 352 NOK and 528 NOK.
*   **30-day ticket:** This costs 370 NOK for the child category in one zone. It offers unlimited travel for 30 days.

Comparing these, the 30-day ticket becomes cheaper than single tickets if she makes 17 or more trips in the month (370 NOK / 22 NOK/trip ≈ 16.8 trips). Since you estimate 16-24 trips and mentioned it might be more, the 30-day ticket is likely the most cost-effective option. It also provides flexibility for any extra journeys she might need to make, without additional cost per trip.

**Benefits of the 30-day ticket:**
*   Unlimited travel within the chosen zone(s) for 30 days.
*   Valid on night buses and trams, which could be useful for evening social events.
*   Includes access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month (though these might be less relevant for her age).
*   If traveling within zone A, the ticket is also valid on trams and trains.

**Assumption:** I have assumed her travel will be within a single zone (Zone A is common for Trondheim city). If she needs to travel across multiple zones, the prices will be higher, but the 30-day ticket principle likely still applies. Please let me know if she needs to travel in more than one zone.

**Alternative Option:**
If you are very certain she will travel *exactly* 2 times per week (16 trips total in the month) and no more, using single tickets would cost 352 NOK, which is slightly cheaper than the 30-day ticket (370 NOK). However, for just 18 NOK more, the 30-day ticket offers peace of mind, covers any extra trips, and includes the benefits mentioned above.

**Tip:** If this travel pattern is expected to continue for 6 months or more, the 180-day child ticket (1850 NOK for 1 zone) brings the average monthly cost down to about 308 NOK, making it the cheapest option long-term.",2,2,Yes,

Siden du er 18 år og student, kvalifiserer du for flere kategorier: barn (6-19 år), ungdom (16-19 år) og student (under 35 år med studentbevis). Du reiser fast 4 dager i uken innenfor én sone, og forventer ekstra reising, inkludert nattestid, under Fadderuka.

**Hvorfor 180-dagersbillett for barn?**
*   **Pris:** Dette er det klart rimeligste alternativet for deg. Den koster 1850 NOK, som tilsvarer kun ca. 308 NOK per måned. En 30-dagers barnebillett koster 370 NOK, mens en 30-dagers student- eller ungdomsbillett koster 555 NOK.
*   **Dekning:** Billetten gir ubegrenset reise innenfor én sone, akkurat det du trenger for reisen til og fra campus.
*   **Nattbuss inkludert:** Siden du forventer å reise en del på kveld/natt under Fadderuka, er det viktig at nattbuss er inkludert. Det er det i alle periodebilletter for barn, ungdom og student (men ikke for voksen).
*   **Varighet:** Siden du starter studiene, er det sannsynlig at du trenger billett over lengre tid, og 180-dagersbilletten gir den laveste månedlige kostnaden.
*   **Fordeler:** Som med andre periodebilletter får du også inkludert tilgang til Trondheim Bysykkel og 2 timer gratis bruk av Hyre bilutleie hver måned.
*   **Gyldighet:** Barn kategorien gjelder til og med du er 19 år, så du kan bruke denne billetten en god stund.

**Regler og Kategori:**
*   Som 18-åring faller du inn under **barn**-kategorien (6-19 år). Du må kunne vise legitimasjon som bekrefter alderen din ved en eventuell kontroll.
*   Du kvalifiserer også for **ungdom** (16-19 år) og **student** (under 35 år). Studentbillett krever gyldig studentbevis for inneværende semester, noe du kanskje ikke har fått helt fra første dag. Ungdomsbilletten koster det samme som studentbilletten (555 NOK for 30 dager), men gjelder i alle soner og på hurtigbåt.

**Alternativ: Ungdomsbillett (30 dager)**
*   Hvis du tror du kommer til å reise mye rundt i *forskjellige soner* under Fadderuka eller senere, kan **Ungdomsbilletten** være et alternativ. Den koster 555 NOK for 30 dager, inkluderer nattbuss og gir reiserett i hele Trøndelag fylke med buss og hurtigbåt (samt trikk/tog i sone A). Den er dyrere enn barnebilletten, men gir mer fleksibilitet i reiseområde.

**Tips:**
*   Husk at alle AtB-billetter (både enkelt- og periodebilletter) også kan brukes på trikk og tog innenfor sone A.
*   Last ned AtB-appen for enkel kjøp og administrasjon av billetten din.

For your travel needs within one zone, let's compare the best options.

Traveling 4 days a week means at least 8 trips per week, plus extra trips during 'Fadderuka', including potential late-night travel. Buying single tickets wouldn't be economical. The cheapest single ticket you qualify for is the Child ticket at 22 NOK, which would cost at least 704 NOK per month (8 trips/week * 4 weeks * 22 NOK) even without the extra Fadderuke travel, and it doesn't cover night buses.

The most cost-effective option for you is the **30-day Child ticket** for one zone, which costs **370 NOK**. This gives you unlimited travel within your zone for 30 days, including access to night buses (which is useful during Fadderuka) and trams/trains within zone A. It also includes benefits like free access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month.

**Alternative Options:**
*   **Youth Ticket:** This costs 555 NOK for 30 days. While it covers *all* zones in Trøndelag and express boats, it's more expensive than the child ticket and you only need travel within one zone.
*   **30-day Student Ticket:** This also costs 555 NOK for one zone. It offers the same benefits as the child ticket but is more expensive.
*   **180-day Child Ticket:** If you anticipate needing the bus regularly for the next 6 months, this ticket costs 1850 NOK, averaging about 308 NOK per month, making it the cheapest option long-term. However, starting with a 30-day ticket gives you flexibility if your travel habits change after Fadderuka.

**Recommendation:** Start with the **30-day Child ticket**. It's the cheapest periodic ticket covering your needs, including night travel, for the initial period.

**Important Information:**
*   **Traveler Category:** As an 18-year-old, you fit into the Child category (until you turn 20), Youth category (until you turn 20), and Student category (if you have a valid student ID). For 1-zone travel, the Child ticket prices are the most advantageous.
*   **ID:** Be prepared to show proof of age if requested by ticket inspectors when using a Child or Youth ticket. If you were to use a Student ticket, you'd need a valid student ID for the current semester.
*   **Ticket Validity:** Your ticket needs to be valid when you board the bus/tram/train. It covers your entire journey even if it expires during the trip.

It costs 555 NOK per month and offers unlimited travel on buses, trams (in zone A), and even express boats throughout all zones in Trøndelag county. This is significantly cheaper than buying a 30-day child ticket for 4 zones (745 NOK) or a 30-day student ticket for 4 zones (1120 NOK). The Youth Ticket also includes travel on night buses and trams.

**Traveler Category:** You fit into the Youth category (16-19 years old). Remember to carry ID to prove your age if requested during a ticket inspection.

**Ticket Rules & Benefits:** The Youth Ticket provides unlimited travel across all zones in Trøndelag county on buses, trams (within zone A), and express boats for 30 days.

3.  **Convenience:** It includes night buses/trams and comes with benefits like free access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month.

Comparing this to other options:

Therefore, the only suitable ticket specifically designed for night bus travel for adults is the **Night 1 ticket**. 

**Ticket Rules & Cost:**
*   It costs 120 NOK per trip.
*   It can be purchased between 00:30 and 04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights.
*   It's valid for a single trip on specific night bus routes (101-116, 4101) and the night tram within Trondheim.
*   It does not allow for transfers.

**Reasoning:** Since you only need the bus for your night journeys home from the nightclub, and other adult tickets exclude this service, the Night 1 ticket is your designated option. If you work, for example, every Friday and Saturday night, this would cost you 240 NOK per week (2 trips * 120 NOK/trip).

**Alternative Option (If Applicable):**
There is a significantly cheaper alternative **if you happen to be a student**. Student periodic tickets (for those under 35 with a valid student ID) *do* include access to the night bus. For instance, a **30-day student ticket** for 1 zone costs 555 NOK. If you take the night bus home more than 4 times a month (555 NOK / 120 NOK/trip ≈ 4.6), the student ticket would be much more economical and offer unlimited travel at all times, including night buses, plus benefits like city bike access and Hyre car rental hours.

**Tip:** Double-check if you might qualify for a student discount (under 35 with valid ID). If not, the Night 1 ticket is the way to go for your specific night bus needs, purchasing one each time you travel.",2,2,Yes,"Here it double checks if the user might be a student since the age is appripriate, very nice touch. "

Since your main use is the night bus on weekends within one zone, the best ticket for you is the 'Night 1' ticket. This ticket costs 120 NOK per trip and is specifically designed for night bus travel (valid for night buses 101-116, 4101, and the night tram). You can purchase it between 00:30 and 04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights. It's valid for a single trip without transfers.

Regular single tickets, carnet tickets, and periodic tickets (like 30-day or 180-day) in the adult category are generally *not* valid on the night bus. Therefore, the Night 1 ticket is the dedicated option for your needs.

**Alternative Option:**
If you happen to be a student (under 35 with a valid student ID), the situation changes significantly. Periodic student tickets (like the 30-day or 180-day ticket) *do* include night bus travel. The 180-day student ticket for one zone costs 2775 NOK (which averages to 462.50 NOK per month). If you take the night bus home more than 3-4 times a month (since 4 Night 1 tickets would cost 480 NOK), the 180-day student ticket would be much cheaper and also offer unlimited daytime travel, free access to Trondheim City Bike, and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. The 30-day student ticket costs 555 NOK and would be cheaper than buying 5 or more Night 1 tickets per month.

**Tip:** If you are a student, definitely consider the 180-day student ticket for the best value, as it includes night bus travel unlike the adult periodic tickets. Remember to carry your valid student ID if using a student ticket.",2,2,Yes,Again double checks if the person might be a student to save money.

Since your child is 10, they qualify for the **child category** (ages 6 to 19).

The Carnet provides 10 pre-paid single trips within one zone for 220 NOK. This means each trip costs 22 NOK, the same as a standard single child ticket. While it doesn't offer a price discount, it directly addresses your need to ensure your child **always has tickets available** without needing to purchase one for every trip. It's convenient, as a ticket can simply be activated from the Carnet when needed.

We've assumed the travel is within **1 zone**, as this is common for local trips to friends or activities. If travel across multiple zones is needed, Carnets are available for more zones, but the price will be higher.

**Alternative Option:**
Alternatively, you could simply purchase **Single tickets** (22 NOK for 1 zone) as needed. This offers maximum flexibility, as you only pay when travel occurs. However, it requires purchasing a ticket before each journey, which might be less convenient than having the pre-paid Carnet ready.

**Ticket Rules & Tips:**
*   **Child Category:** Applies to ages 6 through 19.
*   **Carnet Validity:** Each activated ticket from the Carnet is valid like a single ticket (usually 90 minutes for 1 zone, allowing transfers on bus/tram/train within Zone A).
*   **Activation:** Only one ticket from the Carnet can be active at a time.
*   **Availability:** Both Carnet and Single tickets can be easily purchased and managed in the AtB mobile app.",2,2,Yes,

As a youth traveler, you must carry valid ID to prove eligibility, or you might face additional fees during inspections. Benefits include no need to buy tickets per trip, saving time and money for frequent users like you.

Alternative option: A 30-day ticket in the student category for one zone costs 555 NOK and also covers unlimited trips, including night services (except for adults), but it's geared toward students up to 35 years. This could be suitable if you prefer a time-limited pass, but the Youth ticket is more specific to your age and might be easier to obtain. Tip: Always validate your ticket when boarding and keep your student ID handy for inspections, especially during busy periods like 'Fadderuke'.",2,2,No,Doesnt even recognize that the child ticket could be cheaper

Benefits include cost savings compared to buying single tickets daily and flexibility for multiple trips without worrying about expiration during your assignment.

You specifically need a ticket for the night bus within 1 zone, and you mentioned working at a nightclub, likely requiring travel late at night. The best ticket for this is the Night 1 ticket, as it is the only option valid for night buses (such as lines 101-116 and 4101, as well as the night tram). This ticket costs 120 NOK for adults and is designed for single trips during the specified hours.

Reasoning: Other tickets like the Single ticket or 24-hour ticket are not valid on night buses, and longer-term options like the 7-day ticket are not available for adults on night buses according to the rules. I assumed your travel aligns with the Night 1 purchase window (00:30-04:00 on Saturday or Sunday nights), as you work at a nightclub and the date you provided is a Saturday (2025-05-10), which could mean late-night travel into early Sunday. If this doesn't match, let me know.

Education on ticket rules and benefits: The Night 1 ticket is valid for a single trip without transfers, meaning it's ideal for one-way journeys like getting home from work. It's not refundable and must be purchased during the allowed hours, ensuring it's straightforward and cost-effective for occasional night travel. As an adult, you don't qualify for discounts on this ticket, but remember to have valid ID if needed for verification. Benefits include easy access for night outings without needing a multi-zone pass, since it's not zone-dependent.

Alternative option: There isn't a strong alternative for night bus travel as an adult, but if you occasionally need daytime travel, a Single ticket for 1 zone (45 NOK for adults) could be considered for other trips—however, it's not valid for night buses, so it doesn't fully meet your needs.

Remember, you must ensure the ticket is valid when you board, and it cannot be refunded.

It costs 2778 NOK and provides unlimited travel for 90 days, averaging about 309 NOK per 30 days. Based on your likely usage—around 5 weekdays for work (about 10 trips) plus occasional weekend trips, totaling roughly 48-56 trips per month—using single tickets at 45 NOK each would cost about 2160-2520 NOK per month, or over 6480 NOK for three months, making the 90-day ticket much more cost-effective.
