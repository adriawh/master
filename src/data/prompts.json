Since you travel 2 to 3 days a week within one zone, a 180 day student ticket is the most cost-effective option. It costs 2775 NOK, which equals 462.50 NOK per month. In comparison, a 30 day student ticket costs 555 NOK per month, and using single tickets at 45 NOK per trip would add up to about 900 NOK per month, assuming round trips to university 2 or 3 times a week. The 180 day student ticket includes unlimited travel and access to night buses. It also comes with two hours of free Hyre car rental each month and free access to Trondheim City Bike.

        "explanation": "At 35 years old, you fall into the adult category which is for people aged 20 to 66. Traveling two days per week typically means four trips a week and 16 trips a month. A single adult ticket costs 45 NOK per trip, leading to a total monthly cost of 720 NOK. A 30 day adult ticket costs 926 NOK, and a 180 day ticket averages about 770 NOK per month. Both options are more expensive than single tickets with your current usage. However, if you travel just two more times per month, the 180 day ticket becomes the more economical choice. It offers unlimited travel, two hours of Hyre car rental each month, and free access to Trondheim City Bike, all standard benefits included with periodic tickets. The single tickets allow unlimited travel within one zone for 90 minutes, or up to 3 hours if activated after 18:00 on weekdays or at any time during weekends.

Of the single tickets the child category is the cheapest at 22 NOK per ticket, which would cost about 880 NOK given an estimated 40 trips a month. Of the periodic tickets for one zone, the 30 day child ticket is the cheapest at 370 NOK. The youth ticket, which is the only ticket in the youth category, comes in at 555 NOK and includes travel in all zones and express boats.

Assuming round trips, this equals 4 to 6 trips per week or approximately 16 to 24 trips per month. Single tickets cost 45 NOK per trip, resulting in a monthly cost between 720 and 1080 NOK. Carnet tickets cost 450 NOK for 10 trips, which equals 45 NOK per trip, so they offer no discount and require prepayment, locking in funds with reduced flexibility. The 30-day student ticket costs 555 NOK and is therefore cheaper than single or carnet tickets when making more than 13 trips per month. The 60-day and 90-day student tickets cost 1110 and 1665 NOK, which does not provide any monthly savings and offers less flexibility than the 30-day ticket.

All periodic student tickets include benefits like access to night transport, Trondheim City Bike, and two hours of Hyre car rental per month. The youth ticket is only available for travelers aged 16 to 19, so it is not relevant. Short-term tickets such as 7-day and 24-hour options are not economical for this recurring pattern. The night ticket is only valid during late weekend hours and not relevant to this case. Given the user’s consistent travel habits, the 180-day student ticket is the most cost-effective and flexible choice.
