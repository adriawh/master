In comparison, a 30 day student ticket costs 555 NOK per month, and using single tickets at 45 NOK per trip would add up to about 900 NOK per month, assuming round trips to university 2 or 3 times a week.

A 30 day adult ticket costs 926 NOK, and a 180 day ticket averages about 770 NOK per month. Both options are more expensive than single tickets with your current usage. However, if you travel just two more times per month, the 180 day ticket becomes the more economical choice. It offers unlimited travel, two hours of Hyre car rental each month, and free access to Trondheim City Bike, all standard benefits included with periodic tickets.

At 17 and a highschool student you qualify for the child, youth and student category(if you have a valid student ID). Of the single tickets the child category is the cheapest at 22 NOK per ticket, which would cost about 880 NOK given an estimated 40 trips a month. Of the periodic tickets for one zone, the 30 day child ticket is the cheapest at 370 NOK. The youth ticket, which is the only ticket in the youth category, comes in at 555 NOK and includes travel in all zones and express boats. All periodic tickets also includes additional benefits such as night buses(except for the adult category), access to Trondheim City Bike, and two hours of Hyre car rental. If you plan to travel regularly after the semester ends, the 180-day child ticket at 1850 NOK, with an average monthly cost of about 308 NOK, could be worth considering. Also if you think you will travel in more than one zone or with express boat, the youth ticket could be considered. For now however, based on your limited timeframe, daily school travel, and one-zone usage, the 30-day child ticket is the cheapest.

With your current travel pattern you will typically need two single tickets for an out-and-back visit, giving a monthly cost of about 180 NOK. \\n\\nAll periodic alternatives are far more expensive: a 7-day ticket for 2 zones costs 630 NOK and a 30-day ticket costs 1 230 NOK. A 10-trip carnet is 900 NOK, which works out to exactly the same 90 NOK per ride, so it provides no savings compared with ordinary single tickets. \\n\\nAlternative for special days: If you plan several bus or tram rides inside the same 24-hour period (sight-seeing, visiting friends, shopping, etc.), a 24-hour ticket for 2 zones may be worth considering (price is roughly twice a single ticket). It gives unlimited travel for a whole day and can pay off if you make three or more boardings. \\n\\nPractical tips\\n\u2022 Buy and activate your single ticket in the AtB-app before boarding; this is slightly cheaper than paying on board and avoids queues.\\n\u2022 You can change buses or trams freely within the 90-minute/3-hour validity as long as you board before the ticket expires.\\n\u2022 After 18:00 on weekdays and all day Saturday/Sunday, the longer 3-hour validity lets you complete most round-trips on a single ticket if you plan your timing well.\\n\u2022 If your trip starts or ends in zone A (Trondheim), the same ticket is also valid on NSB local trains and the tram during its validity period.\\n\\nSince you only travel occasionally, stick to single tickets and consider a 24-hour ticket only on days with many rides.\"\n}", "timestamp": "2025-04-26T09:46:24.730212", "model": "o3", "time_used": 21.79973793029785, "temperature": null, "reasoning_effort": "medium"}

If you need those services you must buy a separate night ticket.\\n\u2022 Includes two hours of free Hyre car rental each month and free access to Trondheim City Bike \u2013 handy if you need another transport option during the day.\\n\u2022 You can activate the ticket immediately or set a future start date in the AtB-app. It can be refunded until the moment it becomes active.\\n\\nWhy not a longer period ticket?\\nThe 180-day adult ticket lowers the effective monthly price to about 772 kr, but it ties up 4 630 kr up-front and is only economical if you keep the same travel pattern for at least six more months. Since you said your situation may change later this year, the flexible 30-day ticket is safer. You can simply renew it each month while you assess any changes, or switch to a longer ticket later if your commute stays stable.\\n\\nTip: If you start travelling fewer than about 21 trips per month, consider switching to single tickets or a carnet (10-trip booklet) instead, as they will then become cheaper.\"\n}", "timestamp": "2025-04-26T09:57:34.720186", "model": "o3", "time_used": 17.31726622581482, "temperature": null, "reasoning_effort": "medium"}

Du kj\u00f8per den i AtB-appen mellom kl. 00:30 og 04:00 natt til l\u00f8rdag eller s\u00f8ndag, og den gjelder \u00e9n sammenhengende reise uten bytte. Har du \u00e9n utekveld i uka, lander du p\u00e5 ca. 480 kr i m\u00e5neden (4 \u00d7 120 kr), som fortsatt er klart billigere enn en 30-dagers voksenbillett (926 kr) som dessuten ikke hadde gitt nattbuss. \\n\\nTips og regler\\n\u2022 Kj\u00f8p billetten f\u00f8r du g\u00e5r om bord; den kan ikke refunderes.\\n\u2022 Spar den i favoritter i appen for raskt kj\u00f8p neste gang.\\n\u2022 Husk at hunder reiser gratis og at barnevogn er gratis hvis det er plass.\\n\u2022 Trenger du buss p\u00e5 dagtid innimellom, kj\u00f8p enkeltbillett voksen (45 kr) \u2013 den gir 90 min fri overgang (3 t dersom du aktiverer den etter kl. 18 eller i helg).\\n\\nAlternativ \u00e5 vurdere\\nHvis du faktisk er student og kan vise gyldig studentbevis, kan en 30-dagers studentbillett innen \u00e9n sone (555 kr) l\u00f8nne seg dersom du begynner \u00e5 bruke buss oftere (den dekker b\u00e5de dag- og nattbuss, pluss to timer Hyre-bil og gratis bysykkel hver m\u00e5ned).

Practical tips  \u2022 Teach him how to activate a trip before boarding and to show the QR-code/validator if asked.  \u2022 If he ever needs to bring a bicycle on the bus or tram, remember that a child ticket must also be purchased for the bike.  \u2022 Tickets are valid as long as they are activated before the bus leaves the stop; transfers are permitted within the 90-minute window.  \u2022 If most journeys are likely to stay inside Trondheim city (zone A), the ticket will also cover the tram and the local train between Trondheim S, Lerkendal and Rotvoll.\"\n}", "timestamp": "2025-04-26T10:21:58.552957", "model": "o3", "time_used": 15.990169048309326, "temperature": null, "reasoning_effort": "medium"}
