Since you usually cycle and only take the bus occasionally during bad weather, the Single ticket for 1 zone is the most suitable option for you. It costs 45 NOK per trip and is valid on buses, trams, and trains within zone A (which covers your travel within Trondheim). This ticket allows flexibility as you only pay for the journeys you make, without committing to a longer-term pass that may not be cost-effective given your infrequent use. Note that this ticket is not valid on night buses or trams, and it cannot be refunded. Ensure the ticket is valid when boarding, as it remains valid for the entire journey.

As an alternative, you might consider the 24-hour ticket for 1 zone, priced at 135 NOK for adults. This could be useful if you anticipate needing multiple trips within a 24-hour period during bad weather, as it offers unlimited travel within that time frame for the selected zone. However, since your bus usage is sporadic, the Single ticket remains the better primary choice.

**Traveler Category Information**: As an adult, you do not qualify for discounts available to children (6-19 years), seniors (over 67 or with a concessionary card), students (under 35 with valid ID), military personnel, or youth (16-19 years). Therefore, you will pay the full adult fare.

**Ticket Rules and Benefits**: Tickets must be purchased before boarding, either via an app, at ticket machines, or at service points. Always validate your ticket when boarding and be prepared for ticket inspections, as traveling without a valid ticket can result in fines. The Single ticket is straightforward and covers your needs without additional benefits like night travel or unlimited trips, which are not relevant to your described usage.

**Tip**: Keep an eye on weather forecasts to plan your bus trips in advance, and consider purchasing your Single ticket through the ATB app for convenience. Also, since you cycle, remember that if you need to bring a bicycle on the bus or tram, you must buy a child Single ticket (22 NOK) for the bike, unless it’s a small or combined electric scooter/bicycle, which is free.",,,,,

It costs 90 NOK for 2 zones and is valid for the entire journey if activated when boarding. This ticket covers bus, tram, and train within zone A, but it is not valid for night buses or trams. Given your infrequent travel, purchasing a single ticket each time you travel is more cost-effective than a longer-term ticket like a 7-day or 30-day ticket, which are better suited for frequent travelers. As an alternative, you could consider the Carnet bus ticket for 2 zones at 900 NOK (equivalent to 10 single tickets), which could be convenient if you want to buy in bulk and avoid purchasing a ticket each time; however, it still requires activating one ticket per trip and is not valid on night services.

As a 20-year-old student in Trondheim with a valid student ID, you qualify for the student discount, which reduces the price to 45 NOK per trip. Since you only use the bus about once a week to go to the city center (within the same zone) and occasionally use the night bus (about once a month), purchasing single tickets as needed is more economical than buying a periodic ticket like a 7-day or 30-day ticket. For comparison, a 30-day ticket for 1 zone in the student category costs 555 NOK, which would only be worth it if you were traveling much more frequently (e.g., more than 12 trips per month). For your night bus trips, which are less frequent, you can purchase a separate Night 1 ticket at 120 NOK per trip since the Single ticket is not valid for night buses. As an alternative, you could consider the Carnet bus ticket for 1 zone (450 NOK for 10 trips, effectively 45 NOK per trip), which offers the same per-trip cost as the Single ticket but allows you to buy in bulk for convenience.

It provides the flexibility you need to travel freely during your stay without worrying about purchasing individual tickets for each trip. Compared to buying single tickets (45 NOK per trip), the 7-day ticket becomes cost-effective if you make more than 7 trips in the week, which is likely given your need for regular travel.

I recommend the 30-day ticket for 1 zone, priced at 926 NOK for adults. This ticket is the most cost-effective option for regular weekday travel, as it allows unlimited trips within the selected zone for 30 days, covering your daily commute. Compared to purchasing single tickets (45 NOK per trip, which would cost approximately 450 NOK for 10 trips per week over 4 weeks), or even a 7-day ticket (315 NOK per week, totaling 1260 NOK over 4 weeks), the 30-day ticket offers significant savings.

Assuming she travels to social events and soccer practice 2 to 3 times a week, with potential for more, she could be making 8 to 12 or more round trips in a month. A single ticket for one zone costs 22 NOK per trip, which would amount to 352-528 NOK or more for the month if paying per trip. In contrast, the 30-day ticket for one zone costs 370 NOK for unlimited trips, making it more economical even at the lower end of her expected travel frequency. This ticket is valid on buses, trams, and trains within zone A, covering her regular commuting needs. Additionally, as a child, she can use night buses and trams with this ticket if needed, though I’ve assumed her travel will mostly be during regular hours. If her activities span multiple zones, the price would increase (e.g., 495 NOK for 2 zones), but I’ve assumed one zone for now based on typical local travel for such activities. If she travels across more zones, please let me know, and I can adjust the recommendation.

As an alternative, the 7-day ticket for one zone (130 NOK for a child) could be considered if her travel is less frequent or clustered within specific weeks. However, buying multiple 7-day tickets over a month (e.g., 4 tickets = 520 NOK) would be more expensive than the 30-day ticket, and it requires more planning to activate at the right times.

**Traveler Category Education**: Your daughter falls under the 'child' category (6 to 19 years), which offers discounted fares across most ticket types. She must carry proof of age (e.g., ID or birth certificate) if requested during ticket inspection to confirm her eligibility for the discount.

**Ticket Rules and Benefits**: The 30-day ticket allows unlimited travel within the selected zone(s) for 30 consecutive days from activation. It’s valid on buses, trams, and trains in zone A, and for children, it also includes night buses and trams. Note that tickets are non-refundable, so ensure it’s activated at the start of her frequent travel period. Check the zoning map on the ATB website to confirm if her routes fall within one zone or more.

**Tip**: Activate the 30-day ticket at the beginning of her busy month to maximize its value. If her travel patterns change or events are canceled, you’re still covered for unlimited trips without additional cost. Also, download the ATB app if available to manage tickets digitally and check real-time bus schedules for her convenience.",,,,,

It costs 4630 NOK for 1 zone and allows unlimited travel on buses, trams, and trains within zone A for 180 days, covering the duration of your project. This ticket provides significant savings compared to purchasing multiple shorter-term tickets or single tickets daily (a single ticket costs 45 NOK per trip, and daily commuting could quickly add up).

Note that this ticket is not valid for night buses or night trams for the adult category, so if you travel late at night, you would need a separate Night 1 ticket (120 NOK per trip). An alternative option could be the 30-day ticket (926 NOK for 1 zone), renewed monthly, which also allows unlimited travel within the selected zone.

This ticket is valid for night buses (routes 101-116, 4101) and night trams, can be purchased between 00:30-04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights, and is valid for a single trip without transfers.

Given that you primarily use the night bus to return home after parties on weekends and do not frequently use buses during the day, the 'Night 1' ticket is the most suitable option for you. This ticket is specifically designed for night travel, can be purchased between 00:30-04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights, and is valid for a single trip on night buses (101-116, 4101) and night trams within Trøndelag county. It costs 120 NOK per trip, which is cost-effective for occasional use. Note that this ticket does not allow transfers and is non-refundable. As you travel within 1 zone, no additional zone considerations are needed.

**Traveler Category Education**: As an adult (20-66 years), you are not eligible for discounts available to other categories like child, senior, student, military, or youth. Therefore, you pay the full adult fare for tickets.

**Ticket Rules and Benefits**: The 'Night 1' ticket is valid only for the journey if it is active when boarding. Ensure you purchase and activate the ticket before getting on the bus or tram. It does not cover daytime travel or transfers, so if your plans change, you would need a separate ticket for other services.

**Alternative Option**: If you find yourself needing to travel during the day occasionally or if your night travel becomes more frequent, a 'Single ticket' for 1 zone (45 NOK per trip) could be a good secondary option for daytime travel. However, since your primary need is for night bus travel, 'Night 1' remains the best fit.

**Tip**: Always check the night bus schedules (101-116, 4101) or night tram availability on weekends to ensure they align with your party timings. Purchase the 'Night 1' ticket via the ATB app or at designated points to avoid any last-minute issues, especially since it must be bought between 00:30-04:00 on Saturday and Sunday nights.",,,,,

This ticket is a bundle of single tickets (typically 10 trips) that can be used as needed over time, making it convenient for infrequent bus trips to visit friends or attend activities. For a child in zone 1, the cost is 220 NOK, which breaks down to 22 NOK per trip, the same as a single ticket, but it saves you from having to purchase individual tickets each time. It is valid on buses, as well as trams and trains within zone A, and ensures your child always has a ticket ready for travel. Note that this ticket is not valid for night buses or night trams, but since you haven’t mentioned nighttime travel, I assume this isn’t a concern. Tickets cannot be refunded, and only one ticket can be activated at a time. As a child (6-19 years), your son qualifies for the discounted child fare across most ticket types.

As an alternative, you could consider purchasing Single tickets as needed for 22 NOK per trip in zone 1. This might be suitable if your child travels very rarely, as it avoids upfront costs, but it requires more frequent purchasing and could be less convenient. I’ve assumed travel within 1 zone since specific travel distances or zones weren’t mentioned; if your child needs to travel across multiple zones, let me know, and I can adjust the recommendation.

Traveler Category Education: Your child falls under the 'child' category (6-19 years), which offers discounted fares on most ticket types compared to adult fares. Always ensure your child carries proof of age (if requested during ticket inspection) to avoid additional fees.

Tip: Keep the Carnet bus ticket in a safe place or use a mobile app (if available) to store tickets digitally, so your child doesn’t lose them. Also, familiarize your child with the bus routes and schedules to ensure safe and smooth travel.",,,,,

Since you only travel about once a week to the city centre (roughly 4-5 times a month) and use the night bus once a month, buying individual Single tickets is more cost-effective than a period ticket like the 30-day ticket, which costs 555 NOK for 1 zone in the student category. For the night bus, note that the regular Single ticket is not valid, so you would need to purchase a separate 'Night 1' ticket for 120 NOK when you use it. This still keeps your total monthly cost lower than a period ticket, as 5 Single tickets (225 NOK) plus 1 Night ticket (120 NOK) would be around 345 NOK, compared to the 30-day ticket's cost.

Given that you live in the same zone as your campus (Zone A) and plan to use the bus frequently (4 days a week for classes plus additional trips), this ticket offers the best value and flexibility. As a student starting in Trondheim, this ticket covers all your travel needs without the worry of additional costs for night travel or frequent trips. As an alternative, you could consider a 30-day ticket for students in 1 zone, which costs 555 NOK as well. However, it does not include night buses or night trams for the adult/student category, which makes the Youth ticket more suitable for your situation.

A single adult ticket for 2 zones costs 90 NOK per trip. Assuming 2 trips per day (to and from the event) over 4 days, that's a total of 8 trips, costing 720 NOK. In comparison, a 7-day adult ticket for 2 zones costs 630 NOK, which is slightly cheaper but offers unlimited travel during those 7 days. However, since your travel is limited to specific trips and you’re staying for only 4 days, single tickets provide more flexibility without overpaying for unused travel time. Single tickets are valid for the entire journey within the selected zones if activated when boarding, allow transfers between buses and trams within 90 minutes (or up to 3 hours if activated after 18:00 on weekdays or anytime on weekends), and can also be used on trains and trams within zone A if applicable. An alternative option could be the 7-day ticket if you anticipate additional spontaneous trips during your stay, as it offers unlimited travel within 2 zones, access to night buses (except for the adult category), free use of Trondheim City Bike, and 2 hours of Hyre car rental. A tip: purchase your tickets via the ATB app or at ticket machines to save time, and always validate your ticket when boarding to avoid fines.",,,,,

They usually cycle but occasionally take the bus within 1 zone in Trondheim when the weather is bad. Since the frequency of bus usage is not specified beyond 'sometimes,' I am assuming a low frequency of travel, such as 1-2 times per month on average, as bad weather days are sporadic and not daily. For an adult, a single ticket costs 45 NOK per trip. Assuming 2 trips per month, the cost would be approximately 90 NOK. A carnet ticket for 10 trips costs 450 NOK, which equates to 45 NOK per trip, offering no discount and requiring a larger upfront payment, which is less flexible for infrequent use. A 30-day adult ticket for 1 zone costs 926 NOK, which is far more expensive than the estimated monthly cost of single tickets for low-frequency travel. Longer-term tickets like the 60-day (1852 NOK), 90-day (2778 NOK), or 180-day (4630 NOK) tickets are even less cost-effective for such sporadic usage.

A single child ticket costs 22 NOK per trip, which would total 352 to 528 NOK for the month. However, since you mentioned her frequency might be higher, I recommend the 30-day child ticket for one zone, which costs 370 NOK. This ticket offers unlimited travel within the zone for 30 days, making it more cost-effective if she travels more than 17 times in the month, which seems likely given the potential for additional trips.

She will be taking the bus to and from social events and soccer practice for the coming month, with an estimated frequency of 2 to 3 times a week, though it might be more. Assuming each event or practice involves a round trip, this translates to 4 to 6 trips per week, or approximately 16 to 24 trips per month. However, since the frequency might increase, I will also consider a slightly higher usage scenario. A single child ticket for one zone costs 22 NOK, resulting in a monthly cost of 352 to 528 NOK for 16 to 24 trips. The carnet ticket for 10 trips costs 220 NOK, which is the same price per trip (22 NOK) as single tickets, offering no discount and requiring upfront payment, which reduces flexibility. The 30-day child ticket for one zone costs 370 NOK and provides unlimited travel, making it more cost-effective than single tickets if the daughter makes more than 17 trips per month (370 / 22 = 16.8 trips). Given the possibility of increased frequency beyond 3 times a week, it’s reasonable to assume she could exceed this threshold. Additionally, the 30-day ticket offers convenience and includes benefits like access to night buses (for child category), Trondheim City Bike, and two hours of Hyre car rental per month. Longer-term tickets like the 60-day or 180-day options are not suitable since the need is specified for only one month. Shorter tickets like the 24-hour or 7-day options are less economical for this recurring pattern. The youth ticket, which costs 555 NOK for all zones, is not applicable as it is for ages 16 to 19 and more expensive. Since the number of zones isn’t specified, I’m assuming travel within one zone, as most local activities like soccer practice and social events typically occur within a single zone. If this assumption is incorrect, the recommendation may need adjustment. Based on the estimated usage and potential for more trips, the 30-day child ticket is the most cost-effective and practical choice. As an alternative, single tickets could be considered if the frequency remains at the lower end (2 times a week), as they offer more flexibility without a large upfront cost."

This ticket provides unlimited travel, including night buses, which is perfect for your late-night needs during the first couple of weeks. It’s much cheaper than using single child tickets at 22 NOK per trip, which would cost around 704 NOK for 32 trips a month based on your regular schedule. Additionally, the ticket includes benefits like free access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. As an alternative, if you find yourself needing to travel across multiple zones during Fadderuke, the youth ticket at 555 NOK could be a good option since it covers all zones and includes night buses and express boats. Remember to carry proof of age or student ID to validate your eligibility for discounts.

Additionally, during the first couple of weeks, known as 'Fadderuke,' they expect to use the bus frequently, including after midnight, likely for social events. Single tickets in the child category cost 22 NOK per trip, totaling around 704 NOK per month for regular travel, while student single tickets cost 45 NOK, totaling 1440 NOK. The youth ticket, a 30-day ticket costing 555 NOK, covers all zones and includes night buses and express boats, which is beneficial given the user's need for late-night travel during Fadderuke. The 30-day child ticket costs 370 NOK for one zone and includes night buses, making it the cheapest option for unlimited travel. The 30-day student ticket costs 555 NOK for one zone and also includes night buses, matching the youth ticket price but limited to one zone. Carnet tickets offer no discount over single tickets (220 NOK for 10 child tickets or 450 NOK for 10 student tickets) and are less flexible for frequent use. Longer-term tickets like the 60-day, 90-day, or 180-day options in the child category (740 NOK, 1110 NOK, and 1850 NOK respectively) reduce monthly costs further (e.g., 180-day averages to 308.33 NOK/month for child), but the user's immediate need is for a flexible, short-term solution covering the initial high-frequency period of Fadderuke. Given the need for night bus access and unlimited travel within one zone, the 30-day child ticket at 370 NOK is the most cost-effective choice for now. It covers unlimited trips, including night buses (except for adult category), and offers additional benefits like access to Trondheim City Bike and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. As an alternative, the youth ticket at 555 NOK could be considered if the user anticipates needing to travel across multiple zones during Fadderuke, though they currently state travel is within one zone. Since the user's travel pattern after Fadderuke is not fully confirmed, I assume the 4-day weekly travel will continue, making a periodic ticket more economical than single tickets.

Assuming weekend travel involves at least 2 additional days with round trips (4 trips), this totals approximately 14 trips per week or 56 trips per month. The user specifies travel within 4 zones, so ticket pricing for 4 zones will be considered where applicable, though some tickets like the youth ticket cover all zones in Trøndelag county. For single tickets in the child category, the cost for 4 zones is 90 NOK per trip, totaling 5040 NOK per month, which is extremely expensive.

Given the user's high frequency of travel and the need to cover 4 zones, the youth ticket is clearly the most cost-effective and flexible option.

Shorter tickets like the 7-day or 24-hour tickets are not economical for this consistent pattern. The user’s vacation of one week does not significantly impact the cost-effectiveness of longer-term tickets since their regular travel is extensive. Therefore, the 180-day adult ticket for 2 zones is the most cost-effective and practical option. As an alternative, the 30-day ticket could be considered for more flexibility around the vacation period, though it would be more expensive overall.

Longer periodic tickets like the 60-day (1852 NOK), 90-day (2778 NOK), and 180-day (4630 NOK) tickets result in even higher monthly costs when averaged (ranging from 771.67 to 926 NOK per month) and are not cost-effective for low-frequency travel. Short-term tickets like the 24-hour (135 NOK) or 7-day (315 NOK) options might be considered for brief periods of bad weather but are generally more expensive per trip compared to single tickets if usage is spread out over a month.

She will be taking the bus to and from social events and soccer practice, estimated at 2 to 3 times a week, with the possibility of more frequent travel. Assuming each event or practice involves a round trip (to and from), this translates to 4 to 6 trips per week, or approximately 16 to 24 trips per month. Since the exact number of zones is not specified, I will assume travel within 1 zone, as this is common for local activities, and it allows for a baseline calculation. A single ticket for a child costs 22 NOK per trip, leading to a monthly cost of 352 to 528 NOK for 16 to 24 trips. The carnet ticket for a child costs 220 NOK for 10 trips, which is the same as 22 NOK per trip, offering no discount and less flexibility due to the upfront payment. The 30-day child ticket costs 370 NOK for unlimited travel within 1 zone, which is more cost-effective than single tickets if the daughter makes 17 or more trips per month (370 / 22 = approx. 17 trips). Given the estimate of 16 to 24 trips, and the possibility of more frequent travel, the 30-day ticket becomes cheaper at the higher end of the estimate and offers flexibility for additional trips without extra cost. It also includes benefits like access to night buses (except for the adult category), free use of Trondheim City Bike, and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month. Longer periodic tickets like the 60-day or 180-day are less suitable since the need is specified for the coming month only. The 7-day and 24-hour tickets are more expensive per trip for this recurring pattern. The youth ticket, which costs 555 NOK for all zones, is not relevant as it applies only to ages 16 to 19 and the daughter is 13. Therefore, the 30-day child ticket for 1 zone is the most cost-effective and practical choice based on the estimated usage and potential for more trips. As an alternative, single tickets could be considered if travel remains at the lower end (around 16 trips), but they lack the flexibility and benefits of the periodic ticket.

Additionally, during the first couple of weeks, known as 'Fadderuke,' they expect to use the bus frequently, including after midnight, likely for social events. This suggests a higher travel frequency initially, potentially including night buses. For the student category, a single ticket costs 45 NOK per trip, totaling around 1440 NOK per month for regular travel. The 30-day student ticket for 1 zone costs 555 NOK, offering unlimited travel and additional benefits like night bus access (except for the adult category), Trondheim City Bike, and 2 hours of Hyre car rental per month, making it significantly cheaper and more suitable for frequent travel. In the child category, a 30-day ticket costs 370 NOK, which is even cheaper, and also includes night bus access. In the youth category, the youth ticket costs 555 NOK and covers all zones including express boats, which is unnecessary since the user travels within one zone. Comparing the options, the 30-day child ticket at 370 NOK is the most cost-effective for the user’s needs, covering unlimited travel within one zone, including night buses for late-night travel during 'Fadderuke.' Longer period tickets like the 180-day child ticket (1850 NOK, or about 308 NOK per month) could be considered if the user plans to travel consistently over several months, but the 30-day ticket offers more flexibility for now, especially since travel patterns may change after the initial weeks. Single tickets and carnet tickets are not cost-effective given the expected frequency. The 7-day and 24-hour tickets are less practical for a month-long or recurring need. All tickets are valid on trams and trains within zone A, which may be relevant in Trondheim.

Assuming 5 days a week with 2 trips per day, this results in approximately 10 trips per week or 40-50 trips per month. A single adult ticket for 1 zone costs 45 NOK per trip, leading to a monthly cost of 1800-2250 NOK, which is quite expensive. The carnet ticket for 1 zone costs 450 NOK for 10 trips, equaling 45 NOK per trip, offering no discount and requiring upfront payment with less flexibility.

Shorter-term tickets like the 7-day (315 NOK) or 24-hour (135 NOK) are not cost-effective for daily commuting over six months.
